Lucid Link Homework

Welcome to my Repo!

Analyzer.py is responsible for the first task of the LucidLink homework.

Copier.py is responsible for the second task of the LucidLink homework.

I think I made the code quite self-explanatory, but any feedback is always taken into consideration :).

You can always call the script -h to receive some help if required.
